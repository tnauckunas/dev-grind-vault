## Theme: First Project Breakthrough

### What I Built:
- Created a Python project that:
  - Calculates numerology from name (character count)
  - Extracts Western Zodiac sign from DOB
  - Determines Chinese Zodiac + Element + Yin/Yang polarity
  - Calculates age dynamically from DOB
- Used `datetime`, custom functions, f-strings
- Structured the project professionally with:
  - `numerology_zodiac.py`
  - `README.md`
  - Clean output formatting
- Final terminal tool feels like a working spiritual/astrological app

---

### What I Learned:
- How to calculate values from `input()`, use `map()`, and split strings
- Working with `datetime` to compute age
- Using modulo (`%`) and list indexing for logic mapping (zodiacs)
- How to build and return formatted strings from functions
- Best practices for file naming (`snake_case.py`, `README.md`)
- Markdown structure for project documentation
- Felt what it's like to finish and polish a complete project

## Breakthrough:

- I no longer try to memorize code. I strategize solutions, research modular code snippets, and build end-to-end logic that solves real problems. Iâ€™m now writing code like an engineer, not a student.
