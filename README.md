# dev-grind-vault

This is my personal learning arsenal a structured, no-fluff vault of everything I'm studying, building, and documenting on my journey from self-taught to hireable. It's where I break down bootcamps, track what works, discard what doesn't, and log my own tech mastery in real time.

Every folder here is either a study series, a deep dive into a topic, or a stack I'm currently building toward a full project repo.

## Live Study Tracks

### 100 Days of Python (Udemy Bootcamp)

* Not following daily order. Extracting key skills to complete live projects under deadline
* Extracting CLI patterns, parsing logic, and modular Python habits
* Logging insights, shortcuts, and cleanups in `python/100-days-bootcamp`

### Building Up for:

* Repo 4: Clearance Scanner CLI (Python scraping tool)
* Repo 5–6: CI/CD pipelines, cloud automation, basic security tooling

## Why This Repo Exists

Because most courses don’t work unless you extract what *you* need from them. This vault keeps everything sharp, documented, and connected to what I’m building not just what I’m watching.

**This isn’t a course tracker. This is a personal bootcamp.**
