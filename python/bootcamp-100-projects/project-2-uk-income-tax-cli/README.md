## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the official [UK Government PAYE take-home pay calculator](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/estimate-paye-take-home-pay/your-pay).

While this tool uses simplified logic and doesnâ€™t yet replicate official tax bands, it serves as a beginner-level GUI prototype for similar functionality.
