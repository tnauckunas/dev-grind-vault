## How It Works

1. Asks for your full name  
2. Asks for your date of birth (`dd/mm/yyyy`)
3. Outputs:
   - Name character count
   - Numerology number
   - Age
   - Western Zodiac
   - Chinese Zodiac + Element + Polarity

## Future Plans

This project will evolve over time as I gain more skills. The current terminal-based app lays the foundation for deeper development in UI/UX, APIs, and automation. Future versions will include:

- **Beautiful User Interface (UI):**
  - Desktop GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyQt`
  - Responsive web version using `Flask`, `Django`, or `React`

- **Advanced Astrology Features:**
  - Full natal chart generation (sun, moon, rising signs)
  - Zodiac compatibility logic
  - Planetary alignment insights

- **Chinese Zodiac Expansion:**
  - Add birth hour + location for more accurate Chinese astrology (e.g., pillars of destiny)
  - Elemental cycle forecasting

- **Numerology Additions:**
  - Life Path, Soul Urge, Destiny Numbers
  - Numerology compatibility between names

- **AI Integration (Optional):**
  - Use OpenAI/GPT to provide dynamic readings and personality descriptions
  - Custom “life advice” generator based on astrological and numerological data

- **Export & Share:**
  - PDF report generation
  - JSON / CSV data export
  - Option to email/share with others

- **Deployment Goals:**
  - Host web version on `Render`, `Railway`, or `Vercel`
  - Package desktop app as an `.exe` with `PyInstaller`

This roadmap helps keep me aligned with my long-term learning and engineering goals.
